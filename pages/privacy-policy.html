            <p>Your information, including Personal Data, may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located
                outside your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may

            <p>If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, please note that we

            </ul>

            <h2>Security of Data</h2>
            <p>The security of your data is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the
                Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect
                your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

            <h2>Service Providers</h2>
            <p>We may employ third-party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service ("Service Providers"), to
                provide the Service on our behalf, to perform Service-related services, or to assist us in analyzing how our Service
                is used.</p>

            <p>These third parties have access to your Personal Data only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are
                obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.</p>

            <h3>Analytics and Firebase Services</h3>
            <p>We may use third-party Service Providers to monitor and analyze the use of our Service.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Google Analytics:</strong> Google Analytics is a web analytics service offered by Google
                    that tracks and reports website traffic. Google uses the data collected to track and monitor the use of our Service.
                    This data is shared with other Google services. Google may use the collected data to contextualize and
                    personalize the ads of its own advertising network.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Firebase:</strong> Our mobile applications may use Firebase, a platform provided by Google,
                    for various services including:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Firebase Analytics:</strong> To collect usage and behavior data to help us understand how users interact with our applications.</li>
                        <li><strong>Firebase In-App Messaging:</strong> To display targeted messages and announcements within our applications.</li>
                        <li><strong>Firebase Dynamic Links:</strong> To create links that provide a seamless user experience across platforms.</li>
                        <li><strong>Firebase Cloud Messaging:</strong> To send push notifications and messages to users.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>You can opt out of having made your activity on the Service available to Google Analytics by installing
                the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on. The add-on prevents the Google Analytics JavaScript (ga.js,
                analytics.js, and dc.js) from sharing information with Google Analytics about visits activity.</p>

            <p>For more information on the privacy practices of Google and Firebase, please visit the Google Privacy & Terms web
                page: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en">https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en</a>

            <p>Our Service may contain links to other sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third-party
                link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of
                every site you visit.</p>

            <p>We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of
                any third-party sites or services.</p>

            <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13 ("Children").</p>

            <p>We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13. If you
                are a parent or guardian, and you are aware that your child has provided us with Personal Data, please contact us. If
                we become aware that we have collected Personal Data from children without verification of parental consent, we
                take steps to remove that information from our servers.</p>
